# Groot Clock - a computer art project

This web project experiment implements a fun analog clock constructed 
from a growth of branches and leaves. The project is named Groot Clock after the tree-like superhero [Groot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groot). 

Key technologies used included: TypeScript, the [three.js](https://threejs.org) 
library for graphics, the [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) tween 
library for animation and the [CodeMix](https://www.genuitec.com/products/codemix/) 
plugin for Eclipse.
