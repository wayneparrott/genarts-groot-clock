# Groot Clock - a computer art project

A fun analog clock constructed from a growth of branches and leaves. 
The project is named Groot Clock after the tree-like superhero 
[Groot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groot). 

The clock is implemented using the [three.js](https://threejs.org) 
library for graphics and [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) tween 
library for animation.
